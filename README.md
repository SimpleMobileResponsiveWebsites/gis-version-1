Explanation:
Streamlit: Used for creating the web interface quickly.
GeoPandas: To handle spatial data (like shapefiles).
Folium: To create interactive maps which can be easily embedded into Streamlit.
Running the App:
Save this code into a file, let's say gis_app.py.
Run the application with streamlit run gis_app.py in your terminal.
This app will:

Display an interactive world map where users can change the zoom level and map center.
Provide a sidebar for controls.
Allow for expansion to include more GIS functionalities like data upload, analysis, etc.
Enhancements:
Data Upload: Implement file upload capabilities for custom shapefiles or other geospatial data.
Spatial Analysis: Add functions for spatial queries, buffer operations, etc.
Database Integration: Connect to a geospatial database like PostGIS for more complex operations.
User Interaction: Enhance user interaction by allowing selections on the map to trigger data queries or display attribute information.
This basic application can be a starting point, and you can build upon it by incorporating more GIS functionalities as per your project needs. Remember, the GIS world is vast, and you can keep expanding this app with more sophisticated analysis and visualization techniques.
